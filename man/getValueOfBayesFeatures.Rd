\title{Obtain the value of a Bayesian feature.}
\usage{
getValueOfBayesFeatures(dfFeature, featName)
}
\arguments{
\item{dfFeature}{a data.frame for a single feature or variable
as constructed by @seealso \code{createFeatureForBayes}.}

\item{featName}{the name of the feature or variable of which to
obtain the value.}
}
\value{
the value of the feature.
}
\description{
Given a data.frame with one or multiple features as
constructed by @seealso \code{createFeatureForBayes} and a name,
extracts the value of the feature specified by name.
}
\examples{
feats <- rbind(
  mmb::createFeatureForBayes(
    "Petal.Width", value = mean(iris$Petal.Width)),
  mmb::createFeatureForBayes(
    name = "Species", iris[1,]$Species, isLabel = TRUE)
)

print(mmb::getValueOfBayesFeatures(feats, "Species"))
print(mmb::getValueOfBayesFeatures(feats, "Petal.Width"))
