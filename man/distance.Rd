\title{Given a neighborhood of data and two samples from that neighborhood,
calculates the distance between the samples.}
\usage{
distance(
  dfNeighborhood,
  rowNrOfSample1,
  rowNrOfSample2,
  selectedFeatureNames = c(),
  shiftAmount = 0.1,
  doEcdf = FALSE,
  ecdfMinusOne = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dfNeighborhood}{data.frame that holds all rows that make up the neighborhood.}

\item{rowNrOfSample1}{character the name of the row that constitutes the first
sample from the given neighborhood.}

\item{rowNrOfSample2}{character the name of the row that constitutes the second
sample from the given neighborhood.}

\item{selectedFeatureNames}{vector of names of features to use. The centrality
of each row in the neighborhood is calculated based on the selected features.}

\item{shiftAmount}{numeric DEFAULT 0.1 optional amount to shift each features
probability by. This is useful for when the centrality not necessarily must be
an actual probability and too many features are selected. To obtain actual
probabilities, this needs to be 0, and you must use the ECDF.}

\item{doEcdf}{boolean DEFAULT FALSE whether to use the ECDF instead of the EPDF
to find the likelihood of continuous values.}

\item{ecdfMinusOne}{boolean DEFAULT FALSE only has an effect if the ECDF is
used. If true, uses 1 minus the ECDF to find the probability of a continuous
value. Depending on the interpretation of what you try to do, this may be of use.}
}
\value{
numeric the distance as a positive number.
}
\description{
The distance of two samples x,y from each other within a given
neighborhood is defined as the absolute value of the subtraction of each
sample's centrality to the neighborhood.
}
\examples{
# Show the distance between two samples using all their features:
mmb::distance(dfNeighborhood = iris, rowNrOfSample1 = 10, rowNrOfSample2 = 99)

# Let's use an actual neighborhood:
nbh <- mmb::neighborhood(df = iris, features = mmb::createFeatureForBayes(
  name = "Sepal.Length", value = mean(iris$Sepal.Length)))
mmb::distance(dfNeighborhood = nbh, rowNrOfSample1 = 1, rowNrOfSample2 = 30,
  selectedFeatureNames = colnames(iris)[1:3])

# Let's compare this to the distances as they are in iris (should be smaller):
mmb::distance(dfNeighborhood = iris, rowNrOfSample1 = 1, rowNrOfSample2 = 30,
  selectedFeatureNames = colnames(iris)[1:3])
